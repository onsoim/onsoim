## [PJ2] K-Cyber Security Challenge 2019: AI-based Network Threat Detection

This project is a process of preparing and participating in a challenge. The challenge serves csv that includes selected columns from a web server sideâ€™s log like ip, port, timestamp, user agent, and so on. Participants have to detect threats based on this dataset. But this dataset includes only benign logs so need to use anomaly detection to detect threats.

**Objective** Detect threats on networks with benign logs using AI models
**Keywords** AI Security, Anomaly Detection, Intrusion Detection, Big data
**Duration** 2019.10-2019.11 (2 months)
**Proportion** 30% (Among 5 people)
**Skills** AI, Python, ELK, Analysis

## ROLE

1. Set ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack environment using docker-compose
2. Preprocess Features
    : Using Python (Parsing, Regex)
3. Test default AI models (Decision Tree, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Tree, Ada Boost, GaussianNB) performance served from Keras
4. Analyze logs manually: Detect threats (e.g., RDP Brute force, Bot)

## OUTPUT

- Final 4th

## WHAT I'VE LEARNED

1. Start of AI (Learned what AI is and the basics of AI).
2. If there are plenty of times, humans can also do as well or better than AI models. But with a time limit, cannot beat him.
3. AI is not perfect as I expected. He needs lots of our help. Also, we need his help.
