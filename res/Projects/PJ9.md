## [PJ9] Cybersecurity AI/Big data challenge 2022: AI-based Malware Threat Classification

This project is a process of preparing and participating in a challenge. The challenge serves raw window-based (PE) malware datasets. And participants have to classify their type of threats (e.g., bot, ransomware, trojan) and families.

**Objective** Classify given malware's type and family<br>
**Keywords** AI, Multi-class classification, Big data, Malware, Type/Family<br>
**Duration** 2022.09-2022.11 (3 months)<br>
**Proportion** 30% (Among 3 people)<br>
**Skills** Analysis, AutoML (PyCaret)

<br>

### ROLE

1. Extract Features
    : Python (PE parsing, Regex, YARA), manual Analysis
2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
    : Python (pandas, Pandas-Profiling, SweetVIZ)
3. Experiments various combinations of conditions (e.g., Models, Feature group, FeatureHasher size, Early Stopping)
4. Analyze false cases and ambiguous probability cases with feature engineering
5. Test that trained models are well (high probability) and robust for specific inputs.
6. Check logic is solid and flawless

### OUTPUT

- Final 7th

<br>

### WHAT I'VE LEARNED

1. High performance requires the same level of knowledge and effort as someone already knows.
2. Even the same dataset can cause varying results.
3. FeatureHasher is not a silver bullet.
4. Fail of AI models.
5. AI is interesting and wants to study more.
