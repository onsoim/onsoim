## [PJ7] Challenges for next generation security R&D

This project is for the overall operation of Cybersecurity Challenge 2019 in Korea to encourage Car Security. The challenge consists of two parts, one is the RED part, developing attacks on given Infotainment (AGL), and the other is the BLUE part, developing IDS to detect other teams’ attacks.

**Objective** General operation of “Cybersecurity Challenge 2021”
**Keywords** AI, Autonomous Vehicle, Challenge, In-vehicle Network, Intrusion Detection
**Affiliation** HCRL (Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab)
**Duration** 2021.01-2021.12 (1 year)
**Proportion** 20% (Among 6 people)
**Skills** AGL (Automotive Grade Linux), penetration testing, exploit, CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System), journalctl

### ROLE

#### RED part
- Development of attacks
- Modify base scoring criteria (CVSS) for the challenge 
- Make a score calculator
    : Automatically scores with an adaptation of changes

#### BLUE part
- Generate a dataset for the evaluation of the IDS
    : Using modified journalctl

### OUTPUT

- [C1] CVE-2022-24595
- [C2] CVE-2022-24596
- [C3] CVE-2022-24597
- [P7] Infotainment System Matters: Understanding the Impact and Implications of In-Vehicle Infotainment System Hacking with Automotive Grade Linux

### WHAT I'VE LEARNED

1. Behind-the-scenes efforts and processes for running the challenge
2. Even if it is a new thing (e.g., field, environment, problem), I can solve it by applying the experiences I have.
