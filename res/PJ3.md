## [PJ3] Development of Security Primitives for Unmanned Vehicles

This project is an R&D about the development of security primitives for Unmanned Vehicles in various aspects such as sensors, communication/network, AI, and Monitoring technology.

**Objective** Development of security primitives and monitoring technology to solve security threats on the multi-type unmanned ground, marine, and aerial vehicles
**Keywords** AI Security, Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Response System, Sensor Security, Signal Injection, Unmanned Vehicle
**Affiliation** HCRL (Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab)
**Duration** 2020.09-2022.06 (1 year 10 months)
**Proportion** 20% (Among  5 People)
**Skills** Research, Python, Protocols (MAVLink, CAN, UAVCAN)

## ROLE

1. (Main) Communication/network security
    - Write patents [PT3]
2. (Sub) AI security
    - Review and study about MAVLink, AI (e.g., RNN, LSTM, GAN)
    - Write patents [PT1, PT2]

## OUTPUT

- [PT1] Anomaly detection model using message id sequence on unmanned moving objects
- [PT2] Generative adversarial network model and training method to generate message id sequence on unmanned moving objects
- [PT3] Method for Recording event data of unmanned vehicle

## WHAT I'VE LEARNED

1. Studied AI from an academic aspect
2. Improved researchers’ attributions.
    - Review and study at least 200+ papers
    - Analyze various protocols (MAVLink, CAN, UAVCAN)
    - Plan and manage project
    - Write patents [PT1, PT2, PT3]
    - Set experiment environment
