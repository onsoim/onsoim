## [PJ4] Automated Building Fuzzing Environment Using Test Framework

This research was motivated to help build a library fuzzing environment more conveniently. A library is a collection of APIs that needed an additional executable to (1) pass proper arguments to a targeted API mad with (2) an adequate sequence of API calls. To achieve them, this study is about an automated generation of (1) a seed corpus and (2) a fuzzing executable using a test framework.

**Objective** Generating seed corpus and fuzzing executable for library fuzzing<br>
**Keywords** Data-driven Security, Vulnerability Detection, Library Fuzzing, Automation, Test Framework<br>
**Affiliation** HCRL (Hacking Countermeasure Research Lab)<br>
**Duration** 2020.11-2021.07 (9 months)<br>
**Proportion** 40% (Among 3 people)<br>
**Skills** Python, Shell, Docker-compose, AFL, C++

### ROLE

1. Expand the project considering the compatibility
2. Infer FA (Fuzzable API)
    : Analyzing test programs (e.g., elf) and compiled libraries (e.g., Archive, Shared Object) using Python and Shell
3. Manage experiments using docker-compose
4. Experiment performance of seed corpus and fuzzing executable using AFL
